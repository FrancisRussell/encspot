# EncSpot

It seems that GuerillaSoft have long since vanished. Before they did, they
released the source for the Windows console-based version of EncSpot under a
"New BSD" license.  This package is based on a version of that source modified
to compile under *nix (though hopefully cross-platform).

Main changes to the source include:

- CMake based build system.
- General reformatting of source.
- Removal of MSVC++ comment templates, pragmas etc..
- Changes to compile under a modern g++.
- Removed numerous unsafe string operations that could cause a buffer overflow.

Both the original GuerillaSoft source release and the source for this package
can be found here:
